# fm4-playlist-extractor

In the quest of finding music that is less known on FM4, I've written a little script to extract the music titles from songs on a given FM4 radio show, and search for them on YouTube to display how many views a given song has, as well as how old it is.

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* bs4
